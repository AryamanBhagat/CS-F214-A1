Assumptions
	
	has_triplicate()
		-has_triplicate/1 can only be called on literals, since it depends on the execution tree and not the value of the predicate itself(which is always flase). This is done because it's arity needs to be 1.
	sublist()
		-sublist/2 is run on small sized lists, sublist suffers from explosion problem and may print true many times before terminating.

Instructions to run code
	-simply run the different files using swipl

Testcases
	
	has_triplicate()
		-has_triplicate([1,1,1]).
		-has_triplicate([1,2,2,2,1,1,1,3]).

	remove_nth()
		-remove_nth(3,[1,2,3,4,5,6],Y).
		-remove_nth(8,[1,2,3,4,5,6],Y).

	remove_every_other()
		-remove_every_other([1,2,3,4,5,6],Y).
		-remove_every_other([1],Y).
		-remove_every_other([],Y).

	sublist()
		-sublist([3, 5, 7, 9], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]).
		-sublist([1,2,3], [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3]).
